Idk what you doing here, but thanks for the visit. :gem:

White Hat. Working on making the internet a safe place. 

We are a small company that wished to deliver web hosting services that allow flexibility and customization for the users.
Currently understaffed, very busy with personal and client projects. Apologies for the website being down, we literally don't 
have the time to work on it. 

Few interesting things are coming, be sure to follow us in all social media! @gscconnect









## Current Projects are:
### üó∫Ô∏è GS CyberPanel Lightweight
OpenLiteSpeed CyberPanel Port | Web Hosting Administration Panel 
This project is meant to provide a administration panel to users that ARE NOT very technical but are trying to 
start learning code, TCP/IP, DNS Management, etc. 

### üó∫Ô∏è GS CyberPanel Pro
OpenLiteSpeed CyberPanel Port | Web Hosting Administration Panel 
This project is meant to provide a administration panel to power users with a beautiful interface that calls you out
on your mistakes or as you make changes in the panel. Doesn't make sense? Doesn't have to.

### GS Linux | Ubuntu Based Distro 
Linux Distribution focused in privacy, security and productivity.

## We are humans just like you. Stop hate, lets unite. :eight_spoked_asterisk:
